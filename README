README for DelimMatch version 1.06, 20 May 2003

DelimMatch allows you to match delimited substrings in a buffer.
The delimiters can be specified with any regular expression and
the start and end delimiters need not be the same.  If the
delimited text is properly nested, entire nested groups are
returned.

In addition, you may specify quoting and escaping characters that
contribute to the recognition of start and end delimiters.

For more detail, see the POD documentation in DelimMatch.pm

CHANGES

2003/05/20: Released 1.06, fixed a couple of places where "/s" was missing
            from the regex, preventing multi-line matches from working correctly.

2002/10/02: Released 1.05, with the plan to actually upload this one to CPAN.
            No real changes from 1.04, just updates to documentation.

1999/04/14: Added returndelim() and strip_delim() methods to control
            whether or not the match returned includes the start and
            end delimiters. By default, delimiters are returned.

1997/10/27: Released version 1.03.  Tweaked the documentation a little.
            Finally uploaded to PAUSE.  NOTE: NestedMatch-1.03, uploaded
            on 10/25 WAS AN ERROR.  Use this INSTEAD.

1997/07/03: Released version 1.02
            Made -w clean

1997/07/02: Released version 1.01
            Support for Perl 5.004. 
              The scoping of $1, $2, etc. changed!?
              POD buglet
            Allow more arguments to constructor

            Released version 1.00
            This module replaces Text::NestedMatch which was only 
            ever in limited release (never in CPAN).
