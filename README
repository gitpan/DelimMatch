README for DelimMatch version 1.01, 02 July 1997

DelimMatch allows you to match delimited substrings in a buffer.
The delimiters can be specified with any regular expression and
the start and end delimiters need not be the same.  If the
delimited text is properly nested, entire nested groups are
returned.

In addition, you may specify quoting and escaping characters that
contribute to the recognition of start and end delimiters.

For more detail, see the POD documentation in DelimMatch.pm
